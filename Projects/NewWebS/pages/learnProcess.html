        We understand today's concerns for security when it comes to our
				computers. That is why we believe in a very unique way of monitoring access to your
				computer while we work. We want to be accountable for everything we do, if a technician is to visit your home, the first
				thing we do after giving a friendly-greeting with a smile, is sign paper work to begin the job, amongst
				the paperwork is a concent to record agreement. This keeps us accountable and is for everyones safety.
				These recordings are stored on an off-line database and is ONLY accessed in the event of a legal matter.
				We want to provide you with safety, peace of mind, and the absolute best service you could ask for!
